Characterization of the transcriptional response of human brain derived endothelial cells to pro-inflammatory cytokines IFNγ and TNFαin vitro

Background:	


Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an auto-immune disease of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by a disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the meningeal brain barrier (BMB). The mechanisms leading to barrier degradation in MS involve effects of secreted cytokines/chemokines on the endothelial cells (ECs), thereby leading to CNS immune infiltration. Exposure of the endothelium to pro-inflammatory cytokines interrupts the homeostasis of the barriers by disrupting tight and adherent junctions, consequently increasing the permeability of the barrier. Cytokines secreted by different effectors of the immune system induce various functional responses in ECs, quantifiable through measurement of the transcriptome. 

Objectives:	
1. Compare the transcriptomes of BBB and BMB-associated ECs in steady-state.
2. Identify the transcriptional response of ECs to cytokine stimulation.

Methods:	


ECs from human brain tissue removed at surgery were put in culture and inflamed with cytokines (TNFα and IFNγ). Bulk RNA-Seq was performed on treated and untreated EC with paired-end fragments on an Illumina NextSeq500 machine, at a targeted depth of 50M reads per sample. Reads were aligned to the human reference genome with STAR. Differential expression analysis was performed with R packageslimma. Biological insights from sets of differentially expressed genes were obtained through gene-set enrichment analysis.

Results:	


Preliminary analysis on three samples per group showed significant transcriptomic differences between the ECs forming the BBB and the BMB. We found that BMB and BBB differed in their immunological profiles for the expression of cell adhesion molecules, chemokines and cytokines such as IL11 and CCL26. Moreover, cytokine stimulation induced significant transcriptional changes in the BBB/BMB-associated ECs. These changes included genes such as SOD2, IL32 and IRF1. Overall, ECs’ response to cytokine stimulation involved both immune pathways (e.g. defense response, inflammatory response) and house-keeping functions (e.g. chromosome segregation, tissue development).

Conclusion:	


The results demonstrate that there are differences in the molecular properties of ECs depending on the structure they are forming. Gene expression changes induced by cytokine stimulation showed that ECs are highly responsive to cytokine stimulation, suggesting they play an important role in the processes that lead to immune infiltration.
